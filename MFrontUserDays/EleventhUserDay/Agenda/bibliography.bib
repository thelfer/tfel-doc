	abstract = {Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements ({RVE}) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.},

	abstract = {This work investigates the formulation of lower and upper bound finite elements for the yield design (or limit analysis) of shell structures. The shell geometry is first discretized into triangular planar facets so that previously developed lower bound equilibrium and upper bound kinematic plate finite elements can be coupled to membrane elements. The other main novelty of this paper relies on the formulation of generalized strength criteria for shells in membrane-bending interaction via an implicit upscaling procedure. This formulation provides a natural strategy for constructing lower and upper bound approximations of the exact shell strength criterion and are particularly well suited for a numerical implementation using second-order cone programming tools. By combining these approximate strength criteria to the previously mentioned finite elements, rigorous lower and upper bound ultimate load estimates for shell structures can be computed very efficiently. Different numerical examples illustrate the accuracy as well as the generality and versatility of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {This work presents a fully nonlinear six-parameter (3 displacements and 3 rotations) shell model for finite deformations together with a triangular shell finite element for the solution of the resulting static boundary value problem. Our approach defines energetically conjugated generalized cross-sectional stresses and strains, incorporating first-order shear deformations for an inextensible shell director (no thickness change). Finite rotations are treated by the Euler–Rodrigues formula in a very convenient way, and alternative parameterizations are also discussed herein. Condensation of the three-dimensional finite strain constitutive equations is performed by applying a mathematically consistent plane stress condition, which does not destroy the symmetry of the linearized weak form. The results are general and can be easily extended to inelastic shells once a stress integration scheme within a time step is at hand. A special displacement-based triangular shell element with 6 nodes is furthermore introduced. The element has a nonconforming linear rotation field and a compatible quadratic interpolation scheme for the displacements. Locking is not observed as the performance of the element is assessed by several numerical examples, which also illustrate the robustness of our formulation. We believe that the combination of reliable triangular shell elements with powerful mesh generators is an excellent tool for nonlinear finite element analysis.},

A rate-independent formulation that naturally couples elasticity, perfect plasticity and fracture is presented, and used to study crack initiation in notched specimens and crack propagation using a surfing boundary condition. Both plane strain and plane stress are addressed. It is shown that in plane strain, a plastic zone blunts the notch or crack tip which in turn inhibits crack nucleation and propagation. Sufficient load causes the crack to nucleate or unpin, but the crack does so with a finite jump. Therefore the propagation is intermittent or jerky leaving behind a rough surface. In plane stress, failure proceeds with an intense shear zone ahead of the notch or crack tip and the fracture process is not complete.},

It is shown that strain-ageing must involve two processes: a healing of the grain-boundary films, coupled with a hardening in the grains themselves. A discussion of the possible nature of the grain-boundary film is also undertaken.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we resolve the role of grain boundaries on toughness and the brittle-to-ductile transition. On the one hand, grain boundaries are obstacles for dislocation glide. On the other hand, the intersection points of grain boundaries with the crack front are assumed to be preferred dislocation nucleation sites. Here, we will show that the single contributions of grain boundaries (obstacles vs. source) on toughness and the brittle-to-ductile transition are contradicting, and we will weight the single contributions by performing carefully designed numerical experiments by means of two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics modelling. In our parameter studies, we vary the following parameters: (i) the mean free path for dislocation glide, δ, combined with (ii) the (obstacle) force of the grain boundary, ϕ, and (iii) the dislocation source spacing along the crack front, λ. Our results show that for materials or microstructures for which the mean distance of the intersection points of grain boundaries with the crack front is the relevant measure for λ, a decrease of grain size results in an increase of toughness. The positive impact of grain boundaries outweighs the negative consequences of dislocation blocking. Furthermore, our results explain the evolving anisotropy of toughness in cold-worked metals and give further insight into the question of why the grain-size-dependent fracture toughness passes through a minimum (and the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature passes through a maximum) at an intermediate grain size. Finally, a relation of the grain-size-dependence of fracture toughness in the form of K(dδ, dλ) = {KIC} + kdδ0.5/dλ is deduced.},
