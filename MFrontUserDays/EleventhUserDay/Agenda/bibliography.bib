	abstract = {Crack initiation and propagation in elastic–perfectly plastic bodies is studied in a phase-field or variational gradient damage formulation. A rate-independent formulation that naturally couples elasticity, perfect plasticity and fracture is presented, and used to study crack initiation in notched specimens and crack propagation using a surfing boundary condition. Both plane strain and plane stress are addressed. It is shown that in plane strain, a plastic zone blunts the notch or crack tip which in turn inhibits crack nucleation and propagation. Sufficient load causes the crack to nucleate or unpin, but the crack does so with a finite jump. Therefore the propagation is intermittent or jerky leaving behind a rough surface. In plane stress, failure proceeds with an intense shear zone ahead of the notch or crack tip and the fracture process is not complete.},

	abstract = {An attempt is made here to explain the observed phenomena in the yielding and ageing of mild steel, described in two previous papers, in the general terms of a grain-boundary theory. On this hypothesis, a satisfactory explanation of the variation of the lower yield point with grain size may be developed. It is shown that strain-ageing must involve two processes: a healing of the grain-boundary films, coupled with a hardening in the grains themselves. A discussion of the possible nature of the grain-boundary film is also undertaken.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we resolve the role of grain boundaries on toughness and the brittle-to-ductile transition. On the one hand, grain boundaries are obstacles for dislocation glide. On the other hand, the intersection points of grain boundaries with the crack front are assumed to be preferred dislocation nucleation sites. Here, we will show that the single contributions of grain boundaries (obstacles vs. source) on toughness and the brittle-to-ductile transition are contradicting, and we will weight the single contributions by performing carefully designed numerical experiments by means of two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics modelling. In our parameter studies, we vary the following parameters: (i) the mean free path for dislocation glide, δ, combined with (ii) the (obstacle) force of the grain boundary, ϕ, and (iii) the dislocation source spacing along the crack front, λ. Our results show that for materials or microstructures for which the mean distance of the intersection points of grain boundaries with the crack front is the relevant measure for λ, a decrease of grain size results in an increase of toughness. The positive impact of grain boundaries outweighs the negative consequences of dislocation blocking. Furthermore, our results explain the evolving anisotropy of toughness in cold-worked metals and give further insight into the question of why the grain-size-dependent fracture toughness passes through a minimum (and the brittle-to-ductile transition temperature passes through a maximum) at an intermediate grain size. Finally, a relation of the grain-size-dependence of fracture toughness in the form of K(dδ, dλ) = {KIC} + kdδ0.5/dλ is deduced.},
