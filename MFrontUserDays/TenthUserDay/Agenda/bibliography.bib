We present the modern design principles that underpin the {DOLFINx} library, and describe approaches used in {DOLFINx} that preserve the high level of mathematical abstraction associated with {FEniCS} Project libraries, yet support extensibility and specialized customization. At the core of {DOLFINx} is a data- and function-oriented design, in contrast with the object-oriented design of more traditional libraries. We argue that this novel design approach leads to a compact and maintainable library, which is flexible in use and makes possible the creation of high performance programs in different languages.},

In this study, applying a recently proposed general method to the two-dimensional (2D) strain and stress tensors, closed-form coordinate-free expressions are obtained for their decompositions which are orthogonal in the sense of an inner product where the forth-order elastic stiffness or compliance acts as a metric. The orthogonal decompositions are given analytically and explicitly for all possible 2D elastic symmetries, i.e., isotropic, orthotropic, square, and totally anisotropic elastic materials. These results can be directly used, for example, in developing phase field methods for modeling and simulating the fracture of isotropic and anisotropic brittle and quasi-brittle materials.},

A thermodynamic framework is proposed to model anisotropic elasticity different in tension and in compression. Based on Kelvin decomposition of the compliance tensor, it applies to any 3D loading. Coupling with damage is made considering fourth- and second-order damage tensors.

	abstract = {The computational modeling of failure mechanisms in solids due to fracture based on sharp crack discontinuities suffers in situations with complex crack topologies. This can be overcome by a diffusive crack modeling based on the introduction of a crack phase field. Following our recent work [C. Miehe, F. Welschinger, M. Hofacker, Thermodynamically-consistent phase field models of fracture: Variational principles and multi-field fe implementations, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering {DOI}:10.1002/nme.2861] on phase-field-type fracture, we propose in this paper a new variational framework for rate-independent diffusive fracture that bases on the introduction of a local history field. It contains a maximum reference energy obtained in the deformation history, which may be considered as a measure for the maximum tensile strain obtained in history. It is shown that this local variable drives the evolution of the crack phase field. The introduction of the history field provides a very transparent representation of the balance equation that governs the diffusive crack topology. In particular, it allows for the construction of a new algorithmic treatment of diffusive fracture. Here, we propose an extremely robust operator split scheme that successively updates in a typical time step the history field, the crack phase field and finally the displacement field. A regularization based on a viscous crack resistance that even enhances the robustness of the algorithm may easily be added. The proposed algorithm is considered to be the canonically simple scheme for the treatment of diffusive fracture in elastic solids. We demonstrate the performance of the phase field formulation of fracture by means of representative numerical examples.},

Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319–1342]. We focus on the linear elastic case where the contact condition appears as a local unilateral constraint on the displacement jump at the crack surfaces. The regularized model is obtained by splitting the strain energy in a spherical and a deviatoric parts and accounting for the sign of the local volume change. The numerical implementation is based on a standard finite element discretization and on the adaptation of an alternate minimization algorithm used in previous works. The new regularization avoids crack interpenetration and predicts asymmetric results in traction and in compression. Even though we do not exhibit any gamma-convergence proof toward the desired limit behavior, we illustrate through several numerical case studies the pertinence of the new model in comparison to other approaches.},

However, the computational cost of such a method is high due to a small regularization length parameter, which in turn restricts the maximum element size that can be used in a finite element mesh. In this work we developed a massively parallel algorithm on the graphical processing unit ({GPU}) to alleviate this difficulty in the case of dynamic brittle fracture. In particular, we adopted the standard finite element method on an unstructured mesh combined with second order explicit integrators. To ensure stability, we designed a time adaptivity strategy to account for the decreasing critical time step during the evolution of the fields. We demonstrated the performance of the {GPU}-implemented phase field models by means of representative numerical examples, with which we studied the effect of the artificial viscosity, an artificial parameter to be input, and compared the crack path branching predictions from three popular phase field models. Finally, we verified the method with convergence studies and performed a scalability study to demonstrate the desired linear scaling of the program in terms of the wall time per physical time as a function of the number of degrees of freedom.},

We study the behavior of the model in one dimension and show how it inﬂuences material properties. For the temporal discretization of the equations of motion, we present both a monolithic and staggered time integration scheme. We study the behavior of the dynamic model by performing a number of two and three dimensional numerical experiments.

abstract = {This paper presents 2D generalized plain strain simulations of the thermo-mechanical response of a pellet fragment and overlying cladding during a RIA transient. A fictitious hydride blister of increasing depth (25 to 90% of the clad thickness) is introduced at the beginning of the calculation. When a pre-determined hoop stress is exceeded at the clad outer surface, radial cracking of the blister is taken into account in the simulation by a modification of the mechanical boundary conditions. The hoop stress criterion is based on Finite Element simulations of laboratory hoop tensile tests performed on highly irradiated samples with a through-wall hydride blister. The response of the remaining clad ligament (beneath the cracked blister) to the pellet thermal expansion is then studied. The simulations show that plastic strains localize in a band orientated at ∼45° to the radial direction, starting from the blister crack tip and ending at the clad inner wall. This result is in good agreement with the ductile shear failures of the clad ligaments observed post-RIA transients. Based on a local plastic strain failure criterion in the shear band, ALCYONE simulations are then used to define the enthalpy at failure in function of the blister depth.},

abstract = {A model is proposed to describe the mechanical behavior and the ductile failure at 25, 350 and 480 C of Zircaloy-4 cladding tubes, as-received and hydrided up to 1200 wt. ppm (circumferential hydrides). The model is based on the GursoneTvergaardeNeedleman model extended to account for plastic anisotropy and viscoplasticity. The model considers damage nucleation by both hydride cracking and debonding of the interface between the Laves phase precipitates and the matrix. The damage nucleation rate due to hydride cracking is directly deduced from quantitative microstructural observations. The other model parameters are identified from several experimental tests. Finite element simulations of axial tension, hoop tension, expansion due to compression and hoop plane strain tension experiments are performed to assess the model prediction capability. The calibrated model satisfactorily reproduces the effects of hydrogen and temperature on both the viscoplastic and the failure properties of the material. The results suggest that damage is anisotropic and influenced by the stress state for the non-hydrided or moderately hydrided material and becomes more isotropic for high hydrogen contents.},

	abstract = {Computing derivatives is key to many algorithms in scientific computing and machine learning such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, and stability analysis. Enzyme is a {LLVM} compiler plugin that performs reverse-mode automatic differentiation ({AD}) and thus generates high performance gradients of programs in languages including C/C++, Fortran, Julia, and Rust. Prior to this work, Enzyme and other {AD} tools were not capable of generating gradients of {GPU} kernels. Our paper presents a combination of novel techniques that make Enzyme the first fully automatic reversemode {AD} tool to generate gradients of {GPU} kernels. Since unlike other tools Enzyme performs automatic differentiation within a general-purpose compiler, we are able to introduce several novel {GPU} and {AD}-specific optimizations. To show the generality and efficiency of our approach, we compute gradients of five {GPU}-based {HPC} applications, executed on {NVIDIA} and {AMD} {GPUs}. All benchmarks run within an order of magnitude of the original program's execution time. Without {GPU} and {AD}-specific optimizations, gradients of {GPU} kernels either fail to run from a lack of resources or have infeasible overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that increasing the problem size by either increasing the number of threads or increasing the work per thread, does not substantially impact the overhead from differentiation.},

	abstract = {Derivatives are key to numerous science, engineering, and machine learning applications. While existing tools generate derivatives of programs in a single language, modern parallel applications combine a set of frameworks and languages to leverage available performance and function in an evolving hardware landscape.We propose a scheme for differentiating arbitrary {DAG}-based parallelism that preserves scalability and efficiency, implemented into the {LLVM}-based Enzyme automatic differentiation framework. By integrating with a full-fledged compiler backend, Enzyme can differentiate numerous parallel frameworks and directly control code generation. Combined with its ability to differentiate any {LLVM}-based language, this flexibility permits Enzyme to leverage the compiler tool chain for parallel and differentiation-specific optimizations.We differentiate nine distinct versions of the {LULESH} and {miniBUDE} applications, written in different programming languages (C++, Julia) and parallel frameworks ({OpenMP}, {MPI}, {RAJA}, Julia tasks, {MPI}.jl), demonstrating similar scalability to the original program. On benchmarks with 64 threads or nodes, we find a differentiation overhead of 3.4 - 6.8× on C++ and 5.4 - 12.5× on Julia.},
